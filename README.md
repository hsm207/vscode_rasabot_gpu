# Introduction

This repository contains code to accompany my Medium blog post titled [How I Use Docker To Train Rasa 2.1.x Bots On A GPU](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/how-i-use-docker-to-train-rasa-2-1-x-bots-on-a-gpu-442cd9d31d67).

This repo is the same the as [vscode_rasabot](https://github.com/hsm207/vscode_rasabot) but with support for GPU training!
